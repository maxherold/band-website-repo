# band-website-repo

This is the first website I have ever built.
I needed a website/social hub for my band.
During the first week of this assignment,
I spent hours just trying to get a second webpage
to link to my home page.
Now that the project's time is completed, it is safe
to say that I have come to learn a great deal about creating
and formatting a website. I will keep updating this webpage
regularly from here-on-out.
