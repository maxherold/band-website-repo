# band-website-repo

This is the first website I have ever built.
Working in HTML and CSS is something I have
always wanted to do, and I have a special interest
in the combination of art and computers. When I was
assigned this project, I wanted to do it on
something I knew I would put effort into. I decided
I needed a website/social hub for my band, and the idea
took off from there. During the first week of this assignment,
I spent hours just trying to get a second webpage
to link to my home page. I added custom logos, pictures, audio and video,
and even utilized multiple social media platforms in order
to see this project through and make it more professional.
Now that the project's time is completed, it is safe to say that
I have come to learn a great deal about creating
and formatting a website. There is a long way for me to go, and
I am excited to get better at this! I will keep updating this webpage
regularly from here-on-out. - Max
